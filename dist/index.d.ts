/**
 * # Generate RDFS vocabulary files from YAML
 *
 * This script in this module converts a simple [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) vocabulary, described in [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/),
 * into a formal [RDFS](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) in [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/), [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
 * and [HTML+RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/). Optionally, a simple [JSON-LD `@context`](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context)
 * is also generated for the vocabulary. Neither the script nor the YAML format is prepared for complex vocabularies; its primary goal is to simplify
 * the generation of simple, straightforward RDFS vocabularies not requiring, for instance, sophisticated OWL statements.
 *
 * When running, the script relies on two files:
 *
 * 1. The `vocabulary.yml` file, containing the definition for the vocabulary entries. (It is also possible to use a different name for the YAML file, see below.)
 * 2. The `template.html` file, used to create the HTML file version of the vocabulary. (It is also possible to use a different name for the template file, see below.)
 *
 * For further details, see the more detailed documentation on [GitHub](https://w3c.github.io/yml2vocab/).
