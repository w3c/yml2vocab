    comment: A service is a set of properties that describe a service endpoint, and should be defined through subclasses to this class. In order to maximize interoperability, the service type and its associated properties should be registered in the [[[did-spec-registries]]]Â [[did-spec-registries]].

    comment: Historically, this property has often been expressed using `capabilityDelegation` as a shortened term in JSON-LD. Since this shortened term and its mapping to this property are in significant use in the ecosystem, the inconsistency between the short term name (`capabilityDelegation`) and the property identifier (`...#capabilityDelegationMethod`) is expected and should not trigger an error.
